What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

I could see the basics in how to make a flappy bird clone type game.

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

 They took a more comical route by making their game about corona the beer brand. So it includes a beer bottle and limes as coins.

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

There player movement was very smooth and seemed to apply to the ing game gravity very well.
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

 The sounds seemed all over the place. The sounds seemed very chaotic and whenever I died the music would restart.

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 Nothing seemed too confusing they made it a very simple game which was good for these time constraints.

Is it clear that every group member participated?

 It seemed like everyone contributed, but one person was in charge of art and assets and all of them were simple and some royalty free images were used. I feel like if that was the persons only job they should have put more effort into it compared to there others.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 I would like to know whey the obstacle was hand and the background was a crown. I realize the crown goes with the prompt, but it doesn't go with the theme of their game at all. I sort of understand the hands, but it needs more explaination.

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

I'd say that is very playable and I enjoy the level of difficulty.

How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
Id say that this project was pretty good I give it 4 out of the 5

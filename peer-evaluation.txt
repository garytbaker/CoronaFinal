Project: Flappy Beer
Group's repository: Coronafinal



What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?
I learned that having precise collisions on a 2D platform, especially one built around jumping, is an important consideration.

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
It reflects the theme in the sense that you play as a pint of corona beer. Not the coronavirus, but still technically corona. Although I suppose one could say that the game is about avoiding physical contact with other people, with the obstacles being giant hands.
 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
Definitely this games sense of humor and having an animated player model.
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
I might choose to add some randomness to the level, making each run different than the last. Also, I would leave extra space between the obstacles that appear consecutively at the same elevation.
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
Not really. All the variables made sense and functions all served a logical purpose.
 

Is it clear that every group member participated?
Yes
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes
 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
Maybe describe some of the design choices in a bit more depth.
 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
I loved how well it controlled as well as the overall appearance of the game, from its consistent color scheme to the animated bubbles on the player.


How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
5.

What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

	Most college students aren't concerned about the pandemic, they're more concerned about the beer. LOL. 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

	It's based off the beer, Corona.

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

	I really liked how pixelated the beer was - this would be nice for a really cartoonish game. 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

	Maybe for the hands to be a bit smaller.

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

	Not really, I think it all made sense. 

Is it clear that every group member participated?

	Yes. 
 
Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

	Yes. 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

	I think it had everything it needed to be successful!

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

	This game is super hilarious - I would definitely recommend it!

How many of your points would you allocate to this project?

	3.

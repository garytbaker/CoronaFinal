Project: Flappy Beer by Tipsy Productions
Group's repository: https://github.com/garytbaker/CoronaFinal



What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

* i'm personally reminded of how much I suck at Flappy Bird-esque games, that's one thing. but in all seriousness, this game's creative idea and concept proves just how anyone can make an awesome game out of anything. like... I never would have thought about college students mostly thinking about beer or alcohol during the virus. 
 



In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

 * like what the README states, it's about what's on the mind of college students. an ice cold beer with a little (or a lot) of lime in it. i mean yeah, some kids would be panicking, but others may just be wanting to drink the pandemic away. there's definitely time to do that now.




What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

* the brilliant feature of being able to use other controllers, such as an XBOX controller.
 



What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

* like I said, I suck at Flappy Bird-like games and so I kept dying quickly, maybe reduce the size of the hands or how high you get propelled when you click the button.
 



Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

* i mean i suck at programming, i'm an artist, so it was all pretty confusing. whatever they did that lets other controllers be usable is really beyond me.
 


Is it clear that every group member participated?

* of course. it seems like lots of effort went into the sounds, the graphics, and menu design. really, everything was made nicely.



Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

* yessir, it does.



What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

* can't really think of anything- maybe talk about how you guys organized everything together? how long the project took you overall, and if any inspirations were drawn from other games or ideas?
 


Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

*i think your game is extremely creative and almost follows a "sub-theme" of the coronavirus theme. how people will react to it.
	the game is solid with it's concept and mechanics, and I love the work that went into the catchy music and sounds.



How many of your points would you allocate to this project?

* overall, i'd give this a solid 4 out of 5 points.
